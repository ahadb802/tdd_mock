<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

#### Select your platform
 - MacOS
 - Ubuntu
 - Windows

### Tools on Unix based systems

There are several tools that can be used to install Ruby on your local machine. The most popular are:
```sh
   rbenv
   RVM
   asdf
```
We will go with rbenv because it does not override any of the system shell scripts like RVM and it allows us to compile older Ruby versions that will fail with RVM.

## MacOS

Run the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
brew install rbenv ruby-build
echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
rbenv install 3.0.1
rbenv global 3.0.1
ruby -v
```
> Note: If you are using a shell other than bash, for example zsh, you should change the first line to use zshrc like this:
```sh
echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.zshrc
```
> or any other config file of your shell.

## Ubuntu

> You can install Ruby on Ubuntu in several ways. The easiest way is to run the following command (source):
```sh
  sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```
If that doesn't work, you can try installing Ruby using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). This is a version manager tool for the Ruby programming language on Unix-like systems.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

rbenv install 3.0.1
rbenv global 3.0.1
ruby -v
```
consider checking [ Install ruby on Ubuntu 20.04 with rbenv.](https://linuxtut.com/install-ruby-on-ubuntu-20.04-with-rbenv-e419f/)

## Windows
Installing Ruby on Windows is a little more difficult than installing it on another OS. We would recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), but you can also try to install Ruby directly on your OS with [rubyinstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

```sh
WSL only works on 64-bit installations of Windows.
```

If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows 10, we recommend following [this](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) article to install Ruby.

If you can not use WSL then you should follow these steps:

> Download the last version of [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
> Run RubyInstaller and follow the steps described [here](https://stackify.com/install-ruby-on-windows-everything-you-need-to-get-going/).
